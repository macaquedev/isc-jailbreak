# isc-jailbreak

Install the userscript using a tool like ViolentMonkey (or another userscript manager), and you will be prompted to edit your tiles at will after each move. This works because the tile drawing algorithm on the ISC is client-side, which means it's completely trivial to hijack.

Please note that I do _not_ condone cheating on the ISC. This exists merely for educational and demonstration purposes. 

If you want a website where you can play Scrabble and not worry about your opponent editing their own tiles, play on woogles.io!
